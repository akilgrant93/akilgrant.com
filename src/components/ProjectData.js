Designed as a “third space,” a place to relax in public, encounter familiar faces and make new acquaintances - Black Cat LES is family owned homely break from the downtown mono-culture and the food is great too.','As a Manhattan based dentist Samuel rudick needed his branding to convey a certain professionalism however, people’s fear of the dentist led us to the realization it also needed to show a friendliness so folks don’t have as much anxiety about their appointments.','This client, the is a talented filmmaker who’s always got the best shot in mind. A lot of film branding can be heavy on the references to slates, cameras, and typewriters I went for something that conveyed a similar technical proficiency while still being primarily typographic. This aperture inspired logo was the resuslt.','While in the employ of EIC Agency LLC I had the opportunity to create stationery and branding for a few external client facing projects.

This one happened to be a childhood friend who needed to take his branding to the next level. His music, gritty and rough informed the style of the typography and came together to create design for a slew of content.','A started based curated wine subscription service needed some branding. Their clientele was high end, as was the wines they were selecting so they wanted their logo to convey a certain rustic and aged feel while still having a touch of modernity. With that in mind I created a logo and accompanying postcard to help create a mailing list for the brand.', 'I’m a sucker for local projects. I grew up in Long Island, and went to public schools so hearing that a one of the high school teams in my area needed a rebrand was music to the ears. They wanted a fairly traditional varsity logo and I like to think I delivered. Try and tell me that cap isn’t fly. I dare ya!','To commemorate the launch of their website these folks wanted a really complete corporate identity package. Being an arena flooring service, incorporating sports related iconography was a must - but the cohesiveness of design across a wide variety of medium was what really drew me to this project.','When I first began working as a designer I got the opportunity to work with a lovely restaurant on the Upper West Side specializing in Ethiopian cuisine.

The film takes place in NYC and features a millennial cast and so we wanted the title sequence reflecting both a burning passion reminiscent of your favorite french romance with New York City nightlife vibes. Gotta love that rotoscope.','This piece is another student piece. The task was to do an animation of a logo, I chose Google Earth. I picked this style because I found the multiple stages to be a little analogous to the different colored overlays present within the Google Earth interface.  This is another great example of my favorite animation technique, rotoscoping.', 'A compilation piece showcasing a smattering of the range of my work up to the point I produced the video.
