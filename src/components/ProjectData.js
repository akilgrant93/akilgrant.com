    bulletPoints: ['I recently got the privilege of conceptualizing the branding and menu package for a lovely coffee shop on the LES. Designed as a “third space,” a place to relax in public, encounter familiar faces and make new acquaintances - Black Cat LES is family owned homely break from the downtown mono-culture and the food is great too.','Some time ago I got the chance to work with the dental practice of Samuel Rudick & Associates on their branding. As a Manhattan based dentist they needed to convey a certain marketable professionalism however, a lot of people (adults included) are scared of the dentist. With that in mind Samuel and I realized they wanted their branding to convey a approachable friendliness so folks don’t have so much anxiety about their appointments.','This client, the lovely Cici Chu is a talented young filmmaker who’s always got the best shot in mind. Being that a lot of filmmakers branding can be heavy on the references to slates,cameras, and typewriters we decided to go for something that conveyed a similar technical proficiency while still being primarily typographic. To that end this aperture inspired logo was what we created.','While in the employ of EIC Agency LLC I had the opportunity to create stationery and branding for a few external client facing projects. In this case I created a rack and business card set for a Long Island based pizzeria to promote the launch of their gluten-free line of pizza dough.', 'Being that New York has a pretty big underground hip-hop scene its fairly easy to get looped into working with the rappers who make it happen. This one happened to be a childhood friend who needed to take his branding to the next level. His music, being gritty and rough around the edges really informed the style of the typography and really came together to create an interesting design for t-shirts.','These young entrepreneurs were starting a curated wine subscription service and needed some branding. Their clientele was high end, as was the wines they were selecting so they wanted their logo to convey a certain rustic and aged feel while still having a touch of modernity. With that in mind I created this logo and the accompanying postcard to help them create a mailing list to promote their product.', 'I’m a sucker for local projects. I grew up in Long Island, and went to public schools so hearing that a one of the high school teams in my area needed a rebrand was music to the ears. They wanted a fairly traditional varsity logo and I like to think I delivered. Try and tell me that cap isn’t fly. I dare ya!','To commemorate the launch of their website these folks wanted a really complete corporate identity package. Being an arena flooring service, incorporating sports related iconography was a must - but the cohesiveness of design across a wide variety of medium was what really drew me to this project.','When I first began working as a designer I got the opportunity to work with a lovely restaurant on the Upper West Side specializing in Ethiopian cuisine. Their logo was already in place when we met and it set the tone for the great imagery present in both the tri-fold menu and the catering card shown below.','You ever have an internship from hell that you don’t realize was a mess until you leave it? For me EIC Agency was that place. I was a wet behind the ears sophomore in college looking to cut my teeth at an agency, any agency and boy did I get more than I bargained for. 40 hour work weeks without pay, books to be read (and tested upon) weekly, and a hostile work environment to boot. In the end though, I got my college credits, a salaried position and some portfolio quality work. That’s gotta count for something right? A lot of what I did for them was in-house branding and printed material as well as logos for SEO websites, the best examples are shown below.']

To fit that tone I animated this title sequence for the film. The film takes place in NYC and features a millennial cast and so we wanted the title sequence reflecting both a burning passion reminiscent of your favorite french romance with New York City nightlife vibes. Gotta love that rotoscope.', 'For this piece my client was a production company partnered with a non-profit specializing in showcasing diverse voices from marginalized communities. They created a pilot for a show taking place in a near-distant future where hate and xenophobia are normalized. I was tasked with the creation of a logo and title sequence for the series. Being that it was to be a drama with a dark tone where a murder mystery featured prominently in the plot I created a sequence featuring an evidence board and vanishing lettering. This was also the first time that I produced the sound for a title sequence!','This piece is another student piece. The task was to do an animation of a logo, I chose Google Earth. I picked this style because I found the multiple stages to be a little analogous to the different colored overlays present within the Google Earth interface.  This is another great example of my favorite animation technique, rotoscoping.','So I’ve always wanted a monogram. My first name has some tough letters and I struggled for a long time with resolving what to do with the "g" typographically. So you can imagine my excitement when I finally found a monogram that actually looked good and read well! So excited I made not one animation, but three...', 'A compilation piece showcasing a smattering of the range of my work up to the point I produced the video.
